## We're Committing to Forever!

Dearest friends and family,

We, **Aminudin** and **Husna**, are thrilled to invite you to celebrate our wedding! After many "commits" and "merges" in our relationship, we're ready to deploy our biggest "release" yet: married life!

We'd be honored to have you "branch out" from your daily routines and join us for this special "pull request" on our happiness.
